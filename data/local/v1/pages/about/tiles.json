The map started with a single gas station, built by him, that still resides in its original form and location in Hunterspoint. In the last 11 years, he has led over 20 different staff members and 400+ builders to make the map what it is today."

Built to a one-to-one scale, every single building in Greenfield has substantial detail with carefully detailed elaborate surroundings. With a substantially sizable airport to lavish homes and businesses, Greenfield is one of the largest, most complex, and detailed original cities in Minecraft. As of July 2022, the in-progress map is now about 6500x8800 blocks, or about 57 square kilometers."

Over the past 11 years, we have seen hundreds of builders come and go, helping us reach our current project state. They range from high school students to retirees and come from a wide variety of backgrounds and education. Some of us are software engineers, others are architect students- our builders'backgrounds all combine together to create an interesting atmosphere on the server and create a product everyone enjoys."
